AI-driven Cloud Security Threat Detection (Mini-Project)

Authors: GIRISH ALLADA 
Dataset: cicids2017_combinenew (≈831 MB)

Overview
This project builds an AI-driven cloud security threat detection system that analyzes cloud log data to detect anomalous and malicious behaviors. It combines preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and several machine learning methods (classification, clustering, association rule mining) to flag suspicious activity.

Purpose and Key Functionalities
The purpose is to discover and classify security threats from cloud logs and provide actionable flags for suspicious access patterns or resource usage. Key functionalities include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of the `cicids2017_combinenew` dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand traffic and behavior distributions.
- Supervised classification (Random Forest, SVM) to label malicious vs. benign traffic.
- Unsupervised methods (K-Means clustering, anomaly detection) to identify novel anomalies.
- Association rule mining to find common co-occurring features of attacks.
- Scripts and notebooks to reproduce preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualizations.
